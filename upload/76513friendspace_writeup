Hacking of Friendspace part 1:

The goal of this "hack" challenge was to make it so that any user who visits my
created profile would automatically have me added as a friend.

From viewing a user's profile source there was only one function in there.
The function for adding a friend.
We copied the php code that this called and appended to friendspace.com.
Next, we went to our profile's image upload and stuck this link in there
rather than a link to a picture on our computer.
This forced the link to be called by every user who visits our page.
